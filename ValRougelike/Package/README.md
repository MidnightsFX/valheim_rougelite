# Deathlink - Rougelike Control
Progression and Choice based death control.

Bringing together players from many different experiance levels often means that some players struggle while others are bored.
Deathlink provides a way to challenge and reward players based on their appetite for risk.

Additionally, death is one of the few things that does not progress through the game. 
Deathlink changes that by providing a skill that levels up faster the longer you stay alive,
and scales your death changes based on that skill.


## Example Deathlink Choices
| Vanilla | Minimal | Hardcore |
